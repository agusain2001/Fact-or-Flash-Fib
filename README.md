1. **Enter a Topic:**
   The user starts by entering any topic they want to learn about (e.g., *The Solar System*, *Shakespeare*, *Volcanoes*).

   The app uses the Gemini API to generate a unique statement about that topic. This statement is either a verifiable **Fact** or a believable **Flash-Fib**.

3. **Guess:**
   The user must decide if the statement is a "Fact" or a "Fib."

4. **Score & Learn:**

   * **Correct:** The user gains points (with a streak bonus for multiple correct answers in a row) and sees an explanation.
